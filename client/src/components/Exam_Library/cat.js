                        admission to the postgraduate and fellow programs in

                        100 B-schools acknowledge CAT scores to complete their
                        affirmations. Around 2 Lakh applicants give the exam
                        every year. Around 4000 seats are offered for
                        confirmation in 20 IIMs.
